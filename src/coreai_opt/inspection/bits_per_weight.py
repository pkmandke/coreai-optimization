"""Compute the average bits-per-weight (bpw) of a prepared ``coreai-opt`` model.

Estimates the average bit width of the tensors a model carries, amortizing
compression overhead (quantization scales / zero-points, palettization LUTs and
per-channel scales). Compressed
tensors count at their effective compressed cost, everything else (biases,
norms, untargeted weights, buffers such as BatchNorm running stats) counts at
its full-precision dtype cost.

This is an analytical estimate, not a bit-exact proxy of the model asset.
It answers "what does this compression config cost, in principle?" from
a prepared model.

Only eager-mode prepared models are supported currently.

Supported model shapes and compression:

- Full-precision ``torch.nn.Module``.
- Eager-mode integer weight quantization (int8 / int4 / int2 and their unsigned
  variants), symmetric or asymmetric, at any granularity. Sub-byte payloads and
  zero-points are packed at ``n_bits`` with no padding.
- Eager-mode floating-point weight quantization (FP8 ``e4m3``/``e5m2`` and FP4
  ``e2m1``), which the spec restricts to a symmetric qscheme and the ``zp``
  formulation, with FP4 additionally requiring per-block granularity with a
  block size of 32 along the last axis. FP4 payloads pack two values per byte,
  the same rule as int4. A ``float8_e8m0fnu`` scale costs one byte per block.
- Palettization at any spec-supported ``n_bits`` (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8), including a
  quantized LUT (``lut_qspec``).

Unsupported (raises ``NotImplementedError``):

- A weight or scale dtype outside the sets this module knows how to size.
- Pruned models
- Weight parametrizations whose dense tensor is not a single ``original``
  tensor (e.g. ``torch.nn.utils.parametrizations.weight_norm``).
- Graph-mode / ``torch.fx.GraphModule`` models.

**Notes:** This is an estimate, not a measurement. A real export may differ:

- It may be *smaller*, because a backend may choose to optimize the export while
  we count every parameter and buffer the model owns.
- It may be *larger*, because a serialized artifact carries structural metadata
  that is not modelled here.
- This utility is intended to be used with a prepared ``coreai-opt`` model. Passing
  a finalized model is not supported and will lead to unpredictable behavior.

Example:
    >>> from coreai_opt.inspection import bits_per_weight
    >>> result = bits_per_weight(prepared_model)
    >>> result.bpw
    8.86
